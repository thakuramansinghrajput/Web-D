    <div> Cricket is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat-and-ball_games"> bat-and-ball</a> game played between
        two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is
        a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The
        batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between
        the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the
        field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal
        include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either
        catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball
        before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings
        ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee
        in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical
        information.</div>
    <br>

    <div>Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over"
        being
        a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three hours, to Test
        matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they
        wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury
        caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam
        enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.</div>
    <br>

    <div>The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the
        expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century.
        The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of
        which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by
        Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australasia, the United
        Kingdom, Southern Africa and the West Indies<sup><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>.</div>
    <br>

    <div>Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. The most
        successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International trophies,
        including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other
        country.</div>

    <h2>History &#127951;</h2>
    <hr>
    <h4>Origins</h4>
    <br>
    <div>Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held
        implement; others include baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more
        specific bat-and-ball games category<sup>[2]</sup>), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table
        tennis.[3] In
        cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is
        thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batter must defend.<sup>[4]</sup> The
        cricket historian
        Harry Altham identified three "groups" of "club ball" games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to
        and from between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended
        target (the hole); and the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away
        from it"<sup>[5]</sup>.</div>


    <div>It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the south-eastern counties of England,
        sometime during the medieval period.<sup>[4]</sup> Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest
        definite
        reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford in January 1597 (Old
        Style, equating to January 1598 in the modern calendar). The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land
        and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness
        that:<sup>[6][7][8]</sup>

        Being a scholler in the ffree schoole of Guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at
        creckett and other plaies.

        Given Derrick's age, it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket
        was being played c. 1550 by boys in Surrey.<sup>[8]</sup> The view that it was originally a children's game is
        reinforced
        by Randle Cotgrave's 1611 English-French dictionary in which he defined the noun "crosse" as "the crooked staff
        wherewith boys play at cricket" and the verb form "crosser" as "to play at cricket".<sup>[9][10]</sup>

        One possible source for the sport's name is the Old English word "cryce" (or "cricc") meaning a crutch or staff.
        In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from "cryce, Saxon, a stick".[6] In Old French, the word
        "criquet" seems to have meant a kind of club or stick.[11] Given the strong medieval trade connections between
        south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may
        have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time) "krick"(-e), meaning a stick
        (crook).[11] Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word "krickstoel", meaning a long low stool used for
        kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.<sup>[12]</sup>
        According
        to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, "cricket" derives from the Middle Dutch
        phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., "with the stick chase").<sup>[13]</sup> Gillmeister has suggested
        that not
        only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.<sup>[13]</sup>
